I used two main resources for help in the homework. This first was a youtube video from someone in the industry creating a highly simplified version of our game quiz. ![You can see the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k).

The second resources that I used was a website shared by my classmates on our group chat. ![It can be viewed here]()
